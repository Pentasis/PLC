# Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)

Is a minecraft mod for automating your builds using the same technology as Real Life factories do.
It is based on [IEC 61131-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3) so it can be used as an educational tool as well.

Mind you, the educational value is to be seen as an introduction on the subject of PLCs. Minecraft is a game after all.

The main difference between this mod and mods like Steve's FactoryManager, RFTools Control and Integrated Dynamics, (besides implementing a realistic industry standard) is the way in which you handle signals.
This mod does not come with complex instructions or mnemonics to process e.g. NBT data. You will need instrumentation (e.g. sensors) that convert a situation or event into a digital signal (true or false).

The mod consists of signal cables, connectors, a PLC and a workstation.

See the wiki for more information.
